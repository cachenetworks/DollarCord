# DollarCord

DollarCord is a full-stack, real-time community chat app inspired by Discord. It includes server-based chat, text channels, direct messages, live presence, typing indicators, message editing, replies, emoji reactions, pinned messages, invite codes, user settings, and role-aware server management.

Built with Next.js 14, TypeScript, Prisma, SQLite, Socket.IO, and Tailwind CSS, DollarCord is designed as a complete learning-friendly example of a modern real-time web application with authentication, database-backed sessions, API routes, and WebSocket events working together.

## GitHub Description

Real-time Discord-inspired chat app with servers, channels, DMs, presence, typing indicators, reactions, pins, and settings, built with Next.js, Prisma, SQLite, Socket.IO, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Authentication with registration, login, logout, bcrypt password hashing, and database-backed sessions.
- Servers with invite codes, owner/admin/member roles, member lists, server settings, kicks, bans, and unbans.
- Text channels with create, rename, delete, and permission-aware channel management.
- Real-time messaging powered by Socket.IO channel rooms and server rooms.
- Typing indicators and online presence updates.
- Message editing, deletion, replies, emoji reactions, and pinned messages.
- Direct message threads with user search and real-time DM updates.
- User profile settings, display names, bios, and account management screens.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm 9 or newer

### Install

```bash
npm install
```

### Environment

Create your local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Use the defaults for local development or update them as needed:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
SESSION_SECRET="change-this-to-a-random-secret-at-least-32-chars"
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
PORT=3000
```

Never commit `.env` or your local SQLite database. They are ignored by the included `.gitignore`.

### Database

Run the Prisma migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

If you want to wipe your local database back to a clean, empty state, run:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### Run Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## First Run

DollarCord now starts clean. There are no default demo users, servers, channels, or messages.

After running your migrations:

1. Open the app and register your first account.
2. That first account will be marked as the DollarCord platform admin.
3. Create your first server from the `+` button in the left rail.
4. Invite other users or let them create their own servers.

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the custom Next.js and Socket.IO development server. |
| `npm run build` | Build the app for production. |
| `npm run start` | Start the production server. |
| `npm run postinstall` | Generate the Prisma client after install. |
| `npm run db:migrate` | Run Prisma migrations in development. |
| `npm run db:seed` | Clear the local database back to an empty, ready-to-register state. |
| `npm run db:reset` | Reset the database, re-apply migrations, and clear it to the same empty state. |

## Architecture

DollarCord uses a custom Node.js server to run Next.js and Socket.IO on the same port. HTTP API routes handle persistence through Prisma, while Socket.IO broadcasts real-time updates to channel, server, user, and direct message rooms.

Authentication is session based. Login creates a database session and stores the session token in an httpOnly cookie. The same token is used to authenticate Socket.IO connections, so realtime events stay tied to the signed-in user.

The Prisma schema models users, sessions, servers, memberships, invites, channels, messages, reactions, pinned messages, direct message threads, and direct message participants. SQLite keeps local development simple, while Prisma keeps the database layer portable.

## GitHub Readiness

This repo includes a `.gitignore` for common Next.js, Node.js, Prisma, environment, and OS artifacts. Before making the repository public, confirm that no real secrets, private data, production database files, or personal credentials are committed.

Recommended first commit:

```bash
